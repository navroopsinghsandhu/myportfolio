I have been part of multiple projects and almost all of them involved team work and timely delivery to client. Apart from the technical skills, I learned to design the timeline for the development phase with emphasis on better execution in programming, testing, debugging and resolving issues. I also learned the importance of communication and coordination within a team which increased the productivity in my work and the quality of product.
