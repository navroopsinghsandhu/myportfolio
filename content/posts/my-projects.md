Projects are the pinnakle in the path towards being an expert in software development. I have been part of multiple projects and almost all of them involved team work and timely delivery to client. Apart from the technical skills, being a part of these projects I learned to design the timeline for the development phase involving programming, testing and debugging. I also learned the importance of communication and coordination within a team which is very vital for the productivity in work.
