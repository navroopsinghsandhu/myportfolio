Programming is never limilted to one language and my goal as a software developer has always been to also concentrate on a technology independent learning along with learning the language itself, building the aptitude for clear understanding and learning in multiple technologies while building a strong base in one technology that can serve the organisation that I work for. Here's a list of technologies that I have worked on during my career as a software developer:
- Programming Languages: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Typescript, Python, Java, PHP 
- Frameworks/Libraries: ReactJS/NextJS, NodeJS, Pandas(Python), Cordova, Styled Components, Yii, Node JS, Angular
- Architectural: MVC Framework
- Database: MySql
- Operating Systems: Linux, MacOS(Unix)
- SDLC: Agile(Scrum), Traditional
