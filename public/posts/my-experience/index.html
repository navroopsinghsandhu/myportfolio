<p>Role: Full Stack Developer</p>
<p>Duration: June 2023 – November 2023</p>
<p>As a part of the WIL team, I took the responsibilities of a full stack developer for developing a web application for Eventivity (a tech start-up based in Melbourne).

My contributions include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Implemented user data flows between interfaces on the front end</li>
<li>Performed bug fixes on both the front-end and backend of the application which includes fixes for user registration,  role based restrictions and more</li>
