I was a part of a team that helped me learn to follow the Software development life cycle and how each phase has its importance in the successful development of a quality product. As an individual, I learned to bridge the gap between the high-level design of a product based on the client&rsquo;s requirements and the low-level design including the development and implementation of those requirements. I also experienced constructing timelines for the client based on a deadline, working with the teammates to discuss problems and then forming potential solutions, and maintainability of the product with timely communication with the client for feedback. Another important skill that I learned is communication within a professional work culture and with the client.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
